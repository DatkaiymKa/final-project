For my final project, I created a text-based adventure game, Captain Zephyrâ€™s Adventure, which explores the mysterious planet Draconis through five interactive chapters. The game features modular design, with each chapter in its own Python file, ensuring maintainability and scalability. I incorporated a class object in the final confrontation chapter to manage interactions with the AI entity controlling the planet. Player choices throughout the game influence the storyline, making the experience engaging and dynamic. I hosted the game on PythonAnywhere for testing and shared it with classmates via custom consoles, as required by the project guidelines. All game files and technical documentation are uploaded to GitHub and zipped for submission.

Technical Documentation Highlights:

Hosting: Game files are hosted on GitHub and PythonAnywhere for review.
Languages/Technologies: Built using Python 3.7, hosted on PythonAnywhere.
System Requirements: Requires Python 3.x locally or internet access to play via PythonAnywhere.
Coding Conventions: Snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes, and descriptive filenames.
Running the Game: Run main.py locally or on PythonAnywhere to start.
Architecture: Modular design with separate files for each chapter, imported into main.py.
How to Start: Launch the game by running main.py in Python or the PythonAnywhere console.
